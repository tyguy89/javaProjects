My submission has completed all requirements,
(multiple selection by CTRL, Lassoo (CTRL+Click),
Rubber band (Click), resizing, moving,
all resizing and moving for multiselect,
copy/cut/paste/undo/redo all works.
Trainer mode works correctly: switch to trainer with
CTRL-T or restart trainer
CTRL-E to editor mode

Rubber band has a few minor bugs when selecting
inbetween targets.
Would not let me change the background colour.

Tested it by running and using every tool in every scenario
I could think of.
